<p>This is a simple fork of PortSwigger's excellent Collaborator Everywhere, with the injection parameters changed to payloads for the critical text4shell CVE-2022-42889 vulnerability. This extension only works on in-scope traffic, and works by injecting headers into your proxy traffic with Text4Shell exploits.</p>
<p>
To use it, simply install the plugin, add the site to the scope tab and browse the target website. Findings will be presented in the 'Issues' tab. You can easily customise injected payloads by editing /resources/injections
